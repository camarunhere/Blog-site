* Mongoose is an ODM library - Object Document Mapping library
/User model  => User.get(), USer.findById()
/Blog model  => Blog.deleteOne()
* The way we generally work with MongoDB and Mongoose is to create schemas and models 
* In Mongoose We make a schema first
/Schema defines the structure of a type of data / Document
   --propeties & property types

   User Schema:                                   Blog Schema:
> name (string), required                      > title (string), required
> age (number)                                 > snippet(string), required
> bio (string), required                       > body(string), required
                                               > Auto Generated ID (string), required

/Models allow us to communicate with database collections

       Blog Model    get,save,update,delete,etc
